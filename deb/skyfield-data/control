Description: Minimal data files to work with python3-skyfield
 Skyfield is a Python library for astronomical computations.
 It depends on various data files to accurately compute moon phases, planet
 positions, etc.
 Several issues are raised by these data files:
  - If they're not found in the path of the Loader, they're downloaded at
    runtime. Depending on the archive you're requesting, some files might be
    very large, causing a long delay (directly related to your network
    bandwidth). In the case of a web server app, you'd cause a timeout on
    client's end.
  - They come mainly from 2 sources: NASA's JPL, and the IERS. If one of them
    is temporarily unavailable, you couldn't perform any computation.
  - In some countries, or behind some filtering proxies, some hosts may be
    blocked.
  - These files have an expiration date (in a more or less distant future). As
    a consequence, even if the files are already downloaded in the right path,
    at each runtime you could possibly have to download one or more files
    before making any computation using them.
